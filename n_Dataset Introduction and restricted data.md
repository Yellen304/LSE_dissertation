Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
1. Restricted data and VDI application

- Documentation of IRB review and approval of your research plan from your institution, in .pdf format
- Personal CV and personal information
- The letter of support from my advisor

Frequent Q&A:
- I didn't find a regular form for IRB review, I wonder whether I need to contact LSE research ethics group to generate an IRB review.
- There are Access with VDI and Access with Traditional License, is there any difference between these two approaches?
